# Dog Breed Classification

## Project Overview

Welcome to my Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project! This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project that, given an image of a dog, the algorithm identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  

### Instructions

If you want to do the original project from scratch, clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
		cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-dog-classification
	```

The datasets used in this project are also available for download here:

[dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location '/dogImages`.  The `dogImages/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.

[human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `/lfw`.
