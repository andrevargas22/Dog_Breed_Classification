# Dog Breed Classification with PyTorch

### Project Overview

Welcome to my Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project! This is a PyTorch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project that, given an image of a dog, the algorithm identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  

### Datasets

There are two datasets used in this project, a Dog Image Dataset and a Human Image Datasets. Both are available for download here:

[Dog Dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). Unzip the folder and place it in main folder with the jupyter notebook, at location "/dogImages".  The "/dogImages" folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.

[Human Dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz). Unzip the folder and place it in main folder with the jupyter notebook, at location "/lfw". 

### Table of Contents

* /haarcascades Folder - OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on github. In this folder is one of these detectors used in the project to find human faces in images.
* dog_app.ipynb - This is the notebook where the entire project was made and tested. It needs access to both datasets in order to work properly.
* dog_app.pdf - The same notebook in pdf format.
* Proposal.pdf - This is the original document send to Udacity with the proposal of the project.
* Report.pdf - This is my final report, explaining the entire process from start to finish.
