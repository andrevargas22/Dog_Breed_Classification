# Dog Breed Classification Web App

### Overview

The files on this folder contain my Web App for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Capstone Project. In order to work properly, execute these two steps:

* **Install Packeges**: Packages required are in requeriments.txt

* **Add images from the dataset**: The folder "static/dogImages/valid" here is empty, but should contain the folders from the valid dog dataset. This is used by the app to show the user a sample from the valid dataset of the predicted breed.

* **Add a PyTorch Model**: In the original project notebook, the CNN model was trained in 100 epochs and I saved it in the file "model_transfer100.pt". This model is loaded in the web app using torch.load, so this file is required. Open the notebook in the main folder to see instructions on how to create such a file.
